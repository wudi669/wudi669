My research focuses on **medical and surgical robotics**, with a specialization in the **control, sensing, and design** of these advanced systems.

**Control**

I explore methods to enhance the autonomy of various types of surgical robots. Specifically:  
+ Investigating ways to increase the level of autonomy in different surgical robotic systems.
+ Developing and applying (explainable) Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning techniques for surgical robot control.
+ Advancing teleoperation control strategies for surgical robots to improve precision and usability.

**Sensing and Visualization**

My work centers on improving surgical robots' situational awareness during procedures. This involves:  
+ Exploring novel sensoring modalities, such as fiber-optic sensing, for surgical applications.
+ Developing strategies for multi-sensor data fusion to enhance perception and control accuracy.
+ Using Augmented Reality (AR) to enhance surgical performance by providing intuitive visualizations and guidance during procedures.

**Design**

I focus on the mechanical and electromechanical design of surgical robotic systems. This includes:  
+ Innovating new mechanisms tailored to surgical tasks.
+ Designing and validating the performance of surgical robot systems to meet clinical needs effectively.
