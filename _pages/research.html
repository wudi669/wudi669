    <h1>My Research</h1>
    <p>My research focuses on medical and surgical robotics, with the goal of designing and controlling robots capable of performing minimally invasive surgeries. I find this field incredibly fascinating because it combines cutting-edge technology with direct, life-changing applications in healthcare.</p>
    <p>My journey into surgical robotics began during my master’s thesis at Johns Hopkins University, where I worked on an MRI-compatible surgical robot project. This experience not only deepened my technical knowledge but also inspired me to pursue surgical robotics as my long-term research focus. I was drawn to the profound impact these robots can have on improving surgical precision, reducing patient recovery time, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in modern medicine.</p>
