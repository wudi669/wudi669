    <p>My research focuses on medical/surgical robotics, with the goal of designing and controlling robots capable of performing minimally invasive surgeries. My journey into surgical robotics began during my masterâ€™s thesis at Johns Hopkins University. I find this field incredibly fascinating because it combines cutting-edge technology with direct, life-changing applications in healthcare.</p>
